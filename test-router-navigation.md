# Router Navigation Fix Test

## üîß Fix Applied

**Issue**: Router navigation was hanging after successful authentication due to multiple competing redirect attempts.

**Root Cause**: 
- Multiple sources trying to redirect simultaneously (iframe handler, polling, auth watcher, guest guard)
- Race conditions between different navigation methods
- Router promises not being handled properly

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Only the authentication watcher handles redirects
2. **Conflict Prevention**: Removed redundant redirect logic from iframe handler, polling, and other functions  
3. **Timing Improvements**: Added small delays to prevent race conditions
4. **Better Navigation**: Use `router.push()` instead of `replace()` for more reliable navigation
5. **Guard Improvements**: Enhanced guest guard to handle auth initialization properly

## üß™ How to Test

1. **Start Development Server** (if not running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Scenarios**:

   **Scenario A: Standard Login**
   - Go to http://localhost:5173/login
   - Click "Sign In with Keycloak" 
   - Complete authentication in Keycloak
   - Should automatically redirect to /dashboard

   **Scenario B: Direct Access (Already Authenticated)**
   - If already logged in, go directly to http://localhost:5173/login
   - Should immediately redirect to /dashboard (guest guard)

   **Scenario C: Iframe Login** 
   - Go to http://localhost:5173/login
   - Click "Try embedded login"
   - Complete authentication in embedded iframe
   - Should automatically redirect to /dashboard

   **Scenario D: Manual Fallback**
   - If automatic redirect doesn't work, manual "Go to Dashboard" button should work
   - This serves as a reliable fallback

## ‚úÖ Expected Behavior

- **No hanging**: Router navigation promises should resolve/reject quickly
- **Single redirect**: Only one navigation attempt should occur
- **Clean logs**: Should see clean navigation flow in browser console
- **Fallback works**: Manual redirect button always works as backup

## üêõ Previous Behavior (Fixed)

- Router navigation promises would hang indefinitely
- Multiple competing redirect attempts
- Console showed multiple navigation attempts
- User had to manually click redirect button

## üìù Verification Steps

1. **Clear browser cache** to ensure clean test
2. **Open browser dev tools** ‚Üí Console tab
3. **Follow test scenarios** above
4. **Check for**:
   - Clean authentication flow logs
   - Single successful navigation
   - No hanging promises
   - No error messages

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] Authentication works end-to-end
- [ ] Automatic redirect happens within 1-2 seconds  
- [ ] No console errors during navigation
- [ ] Manual fallback button works if needed
- [ ] Router promises resolve properly
- [ ] No race condition conflicts
