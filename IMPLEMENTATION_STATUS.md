- Auth store (Pinia): Centralized state management
```

#### API Integration:
- ✅ `/auth/me` endpoint working correctly
- ✅ Token refresh mechanism operational
- ✅ User profile mapping from Keycloak
- ✅ Role extraction and processing
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases covered

### 2. Core Infrastructure

**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

### 3. Type System & Data Models

**Status**: ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE**

#### Complete Type Definitions:
```typescript
✅ Authentication models (UserProfile, Role, TokenResponse)
✅ Store management models (StoreDto, CreateStoreDto, StoreStatus)
✅ Product management models (ProductDto, CategoryDto, ProductImage)
✅ Customer management models (CustomerDto, AddressDto, CustomerType)
✅ Order management models (OrderDto, OrderStatus, PaymentStatus)
✅ Analytics models (DashboardMetrics, SystemHealth)
✅ API utility types (PaginationParams, ApiResponse, ApiError)
```

#### Benefits:
- Type safety throughout the application
- IntelliSense and autocomplete support
- Compile-time error detection
- Self-documenting code structure

### 4. Routing & Navigation

**Status**: ✅ **MOSTLY COMPLETE** (95%)

#### Working Features:
- ✅ Vue Router 4 configuration
- ✅ Nested route structure
- ✅ Route guards for authentication
- ✅ Role-based route protection
- ✅ Multi-tenant route handling
- ✅ Lazy loading setup

#### Route Structure Implemented:
```typescript
✅ /login - Authentication page
✅ /logout - Logout handler
✅ /unauthorized - Access denied page
✅ / - Main app layout (protected)
✅ /dashboard - Main dashboard (redirects appropriately)
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Technical Debt

### 1. Router Navigation Issue (Minor)

**Issue**: After successful authentication, `router.replace('/dashboard')` sometimes returns unresolved promises, preventing automatic navigation.

**Current Status**: 
- ✅ Authentication works perfectly
- ✅ Manual redirect button works as workaround
- ⚠️ Automatic redirect occasionally hangs

**Impact**: Low - users can manually navigate, functionality is preserved

**Possible Causes**:
- Router guards creating race conditions
- Vue Router timing issues
- Navigation guard interference

**Next Steps**:
1. Debug router guard execution order
2. Check for JavaScript errors during redirect
3. Test direct router navigation in browser console
4. Consider alternative redirect strategies

### 2. Documentation Lag (Administrative)

**Issue**: Project documentation (WARP.md, PLAN.md, TASKS.md) doesn't reflect actual implementation progress.

**Impact**: Medium - affects project tracking and future development planning

**Solution**: Update documentation to match current implementation status (addressed in this report).
